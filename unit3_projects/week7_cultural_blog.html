	<h2>When was I happy?</h2>
	<img src ="http://images.liveluvcreate.com/create/f/freedom_and_happiness-290909.jpg?i"/>
		<p>The happiest I've ever been was in college. I can say that without batting an eyelash. There's a handful of words to explain why I was so happy during that time. Freedom. I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted. Away from my parents. Away from the images and characteristics that followed me during my highschool years. I was able to be who I wanted to be and do what I wanted to do without worry of judgement. It was truly freeing. With that freedom, there was a plethora of opportunities in college. I could finally join a dance club without having to worry about what my parents thought. I could finally be friends with people that were different from who I was taught to be friends with. I was able to experience a culture with so much diversity and entertainment. If there was a place to really spread your wings and try new things out, it was NYC. I didn't realize how sheltered and restricted I was when I was living under my parents; that realization obviously came with my new found freedom.   
			<br>
			<br>
		There were so many things that I took up the moment I got into college. Some stuck with me and alot of them fell through. But all of those were valuable learning experiences because I got to understand what I really enjoyed. By learning what I really enjoyed, I developed a passion for my hobbies and talents. With passion, I was able to grow in so many ways. Technically, I got good at my craft. Emotionally, I matured because I learned so much about myself and about life in general. Socially, I grew because I met so many like-minded individuals. The deeper I went down the development of my craft the more I connected with the people around me. My compassion and empathy has grown. I've gotten more sensitive and more respectful of a person's daily struggle. I've learned so much about the realities of the world and I've learned that everyone has their own version of the truth. My values expanded with introduction of my freedom and with my freedom came knowledge.   
			<br>
			<br>
		As I'm writing this down I realized I am very blessed to have this life full of so many wonderful experiences. Freedom, the knowledge that came from that freedom, and the ability to process that knowledge and to apply it in ways to make me happy is an ability that I am very fortunate to have. The diverse environment that I lived in expanded and changed alot of the old information that I kept with me. Stereotypes were smashed, minds were blown, and a newfound perception on the realities of human beings grew. I grew up surrounded by different ethniticities and I thought I knew everything there was to know about race and assumed things based off race. But by the fact that I was assuming things without really knowing things as they were as they pertained to individuals, it really meant I didn't know anything at all. I was ignorant and I was proud of the ignorance. I'm not sure how it was that I got to realize this error in thinking. I've realized that you really can't blame some people for their ignorance. There are a lot of factors that determine why a person thinks and acts the way that he/she does. It can be the environment that they were raised in, their intelligence, the experiences that they've had, etc. There is an infinite number of situations that one will be faced with, so I believe that it's important to hold some key values. I can't speak for others, but I want to be happy and I want the people around me to be happy.
