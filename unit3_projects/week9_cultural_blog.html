            <p> I think a lot of people don't know how to ask the questions to the answers that they really need. Or people make conscious efforts to avoid the truth for some reason. People tend to ask indirect questions that make their way around answers but don't really go to the heart of the matter. Most people tend to be scared of the truth. Some people aren't and they ask the right questions but don't know how to apply the answers. Asking the right questions is a tremendously simple yet powerful tool. I believe that when people do ask questions they generally tend to know what answers they want to hear, not the answers that they need to hear. I ask questions to fish compliments, or to justify my method of living; none of the answers I hear are truly things that I didn't know. I think before a question is asked, a person needs to be honest with themselves. But then, he/she would have to ask him/herself questions within. It gets a little convoluted but the right questions start at the root, and the root should be clear of any waste/garbage thoughts. However, this mindset is generally suited for more philosophical questions. I'm going to have to change my course of explanation and go to the more technical aspect of asking questions.

            I haven't had any problems soliciting answers from the questions that I had left on the DevBootCamp community page because the answers were very apparent and my questions were also in return tremendously simple. However, I do happen to read some complex questions that my other cohort members ask, and there are times when it gets confusing. Sometimes, the ones asking the questions aren't even sure what they are asking for, and from the questions proceeds a foggy journey to understanding. Questions are asked in response to the question and little by little the excess fat from the initial question is shaved into a lean mean answer seeking machine. I've noticed the efficiency of breaking down what the initial question was searching for and simplifying it so that answers can be built up on them. Simplicity is key.
