	        <p>Tumblr is a microblogging platform and social networking website. It takes bits and pieces of the best social media websites and puts it together to create a masterpiece of pictures, texts, and videos. What makes tumblr such an awesome site is its user-friendly design. It's simple, colorful, light, streamlined, and beautiful. It is very easy for a person to sign up and start sharing. The first thing you see when you enter tumblr is the colorful buttons that allow you to post texts, photos, quotes, links, etc. The next thing that catches your attention are the beautiful images and texts that are placed vertically before you in your newsfeed one at a time. The awesome thing about tumblr is its' lack of clutter. If there are certain images, quotes, blogs a person wants to see, he/she can search for it via the search bar on the top right or the "find blogs" button directly to the right of the screen. Once you find a blog that you like to follow you click the "follow" button and any and all content from that blog will be gorgeously placed onto your newsfeed. One of the greatest things about tumblr and personally what I think tumblr pioneered is its' infinite scrolling theme. Gone are the days when a user had to click an arrow to go to the next page for more content. All a person has to do now is scroll down for infinite content. Thousands of photos and posts can be viewed in minutes with just two fingers, but, you'll probably stick around for hours if not days. This feature changed the internet game and tumblr was at the forefront. Tumblr can be used for a variety of purposes. The website helped in the creation of businesses, blogs, friendships, and a multitude of cultures driven by gorgeous images, heart-wrenching quotes, and funny stories. You will never be bored when you enter the infinite tumblr scroll newsfeed. I have had friends who were addicted to tumblr and have had conversations centered solely around things they'd find on the site. This site makes me very happy, but because it's such an awesome site you tend to lose the sense for time. It's best to finish any and all work before you get sucked into the black hole that is tumblr.</p>

	        <p>Reddit is its own universe. It's actually not the prettiest of websites. I find it cluttered, overwhelming, gray, and strangely cozy. I think reddit is more for the intermediate to advance internet traveler. You need a bit of thick skin to be able to traverse the contents and also some years on you because it's not the most PG of areas in the internet. Aside from that reddit is built on the wealth of its' community. There is so much treasure content-wise to be found on the site, all one has to do is dig a little. Of course the most popular posts end up on the front page based on popularity and votes but sometimes people like to keep the hidden gems to themselves and that's when the searching begins. There are tabs at the top of the site for the generic stuff and there is the subreddit tab all the way on the top left corner to get a little more specific. But for the more advanced miners the search button is the way to go. If there was a way to explain the dynamics of reddit, the original posts on reddit are the sparks and the comments that users leave are the oxygen that feeds the spark into a blazing fire. I don't know how many times I've smiled, cried, laughed, gotten angry, from the stories and comments that users put. The users are the lifeblood of reddit and because reddit is a website that treats its' users like adults and does a good job of fostering that environment the information that circulates throughout the website thrives. </p>

	        <p>Youtube is a videosharing website where you can upload, view, and share videos. The first thing your eyes come upon when entering the site is obviously the videos. The content of youtube is almost overwhelming, but the designers have done a good job of softening things up so that you're given a snapshot of the video (for aesthetic purposes), some text describing what the video is about, and the popularity of the video. The site is interactive, fun, clean (given the amount of content), and soft on the eyes. With the array of colors and the number of videos that youtube presents on its homepage, the white space with the slightly grey background finds the right balance to keep me interested and searching. When you a view a video, the control bar allows me to adjust how I would like to view the video, whether it's small/big/full screen, 240-1080p, fast or slow, etc. There are so many small things that youtube has tweaked and streamlined based on user feedback that it has evolved into an amazingly dynamic website. Personally the best thing about youtube is it's "add to playlist" option. You can take any video that you like and keep it on a playlist so that you can go back to it as many times as you like and for as long as you like until the uploader takes it off or youtube does some silly things with the licenses on the video. I've had times where I felt nostalgic about having watched an inspiring video years ago and 7/10 times I've been able to watch that same video from my favorites playlist. Youtube is an amazing website where people have even made careers from. There are bloggers and video-uploaders who have partnered with youtube and made their incomes from by uploading a specific number of videos every week. Usually the amount of money they make is determined by the number of views they get per video. With that incentive it has pushed the creativity content of current videos which is a win/win in my books. There hasn't been a day since I've found youtube where I have not been on it, even if it was for a minute to watch a cat video which usually ends up turning into a couple of hours of cute animal videos and then a wrong turn into wilderness videos and then insects and then crazy parasites that can kill you. Youtube is simply awesome.</p>
