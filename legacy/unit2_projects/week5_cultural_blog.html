	<h2>Peer-Pairing</h2>

		<p>
			To be honest I really did not look forward to peer-pairing. I thought it’d be tremendously time-inefficient and burdensome for both persons. As of now, I have changed my opinion on the matter. Personally, I think Peer-Pairing is awesome and resourceful. I’m actually a very sociable person, but I tend to stray away from interaction when it comes to anything education/learning related. In college I would rarely get my work done when I met with classmates to have a group study session; I thought that I was better off studying by myself. I realize now that I just wasn’t in the right mentality to learn, probably throughout most of college. I didn’t see education as something that I could have fun with, it was always about grades and mindless reading. I also had other new and fun things preoccupying my mind that you don’t really get exposed to living under a conservative family in a peaceful suburban environment. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Now that I’m a little bit more mature and I’ve had a small taste of life, I can sit back and really focus on my objectives. Since I am able to focus a little more on my goals, I actually do the reading and the assignments (or at least I try). That’s a big step up from what I used to “not do”. Doing the work allows me to contribute in my peer-pairing sessions and retain the information that I studied. By bouncing ideas off my partner and solidifying the concepts that seemed wobbly to me, I am able to speed up the progression of my learning. There’s also this sense of not wanting to let your partner down and looking like you have your shit together that lights a bit of a fire under your butt.  
			<br>
			<br>
			I’ve had a lot of fun pairing with my cohort members. There’s a great variety of people and there’s always something new to learn every day. I’ve had the good luck of having nice, patient, and smart cohort members, so I haven’t had a bad experience yet, but even with a bad experience, there’d be something to take away from it. From every peer-pairing session, I’ve learned new methods to code, about helpful resources, and how to deal with the program. There had been a time in which I felt a little behind on my coursework and I was scrambling to get everything done. I had a peer-pairing session that week which really helped me get back on my feet. My pair partner was kind enough to help me through some of the challenges and the next week I ended up doing something similar to a different cohort member in hopes that he’d help out another person. I’ve learned the benefits of helping another person out. Although, there may be a tactical reason behind what I’ve done, I hope people look to do the same thing. Even if it is selfish, in the end you are helping out another person. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The only thing that gets me frustrated during peer-pairing sessions, is when I’m not on top of my workload. If I feel that I’m conceptually behind on the challenges, I have a habit of shutting down and getting mad. I really hope I can remedy that flaw, but given the quality of my partners that blemish really hasn’t stopped us from solving the problems.
			<br>
			<br>
			All in all, I like peer-pairing. I even look forward to it.

	<h2>Feedback</h2>
	<p>
		Feedbacks, giving and receiving, are great. By giving cohort members feedback I’m able to develop a certain verbage on constructive criticism and reflections. Since, there are rules in DevBootcamp on how to give feedback, it limits people from getting too mean or critical of a person and I think that that is a necessary given modern society’s tendency for honesty. The current generation is too obsessed with saying things as it is and thinking that it’s a virtue. There are ways to sugar-coat things and be direct, people just have to practice it more. The Feedbacks that we’re learning to give and receive in DevBootcamp helps to develop our empathy and emotional intelligence.
		<br>
		<br>
		The feedbacks that I have been receiving have been helpful. These feedbacks allow me to view myself from the outside and break down things about myself that I would like to change or keep. I feel good reading the feedbacks that people have on me. They’re generally good things and it reinforces my desire to continue being the nice and efficient partner that I am viewed as. There really isn’t any bad feedbacks and they tend to be more constructive criticism that try to strengthen the confidence that I have in myself. From reading my feedbacks it looks like I just need to have more confidence in my abilities, so I will do my best to show that in my next session and try to take control in parts that I am needed.
		<br>
		<br>
		When writing my feedbacks I felt indecisive. I wasn’t sure how to say the critiques that I wanted to say without sounding like an arrogant ass. So I read other peoples’ feedbacks and learned another way to say the same thing with an added encouragement. I think I’ve gotten comfortable finding the right words to say to a person that wouldn’t be detrimental to the underlying message I have for him/her. More Feedbacks!
