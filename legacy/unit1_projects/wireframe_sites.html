	 <h1>Reddit</h1>

	 <p> The biggest challenge that reddit faces is the organization of all its content. It's a standard news site that's driven by its' enormous userbase. It is constantly updated with information and the trending news posts are dyamic. With all the information, there are buttons at the top that separate the reddit posts into generic subreddit posts for quick access, away from the main content. The most popular news posts are then placed right in front of the eyes, with a small image related to the post on the left, and bold text that describe just enough of the post to get the reader interested. The search bar is on the right for even more specific finds, but since the most popular news is right in the front it's left a little obscure. The general design for Reddit hasn't changed much. Just given how much content there is on the website, it's pretty difficult to make it any better than it already is.</p>
	 <h1>Tumblr</h1>

	 <p> Tumblrs main draw is the big and beautiful pictures/texts that draw your attention at first glance. In order to do that every other button and search bars are second to the main content that is in the middle of the website's page. There's a small image box to the left of the main box that contains a picture of the user who posted the content. The buttons that allow you to post your own content is above the main box and the search bar is all the way on the right corner. The design of the website is tremendously simple, yet powerful. The buttons on the outside are soft while the main content is sharp and bright for contrast and aesthetics.</p>
<h1>CokeandPopcorn</h1>
  <img src="http://eddiekimosabe.github.io/unit1_projects/cokeandpopcorn.jpg" height="65%" width="65%">
	  <p>CokeandPopcorn is an interesting site. People mainly visit the video site for tv shows. Since alot of websites that stream tv shows for free get shutdown, the content has to be placed in an obscure location. The main page of CokeandPopcorn fronts as a website with random videos. It'll give you images labeled with "skateboarding", "best commercials", or "viral videos". However, the main content can be found by clicking a small button at the top labeled "TV". The shoddy design of the website keeps the majority of people disinterested and for the select few who do look around their eyes are more drawn to the bigger images than the buttons on the top of the website, so they look through generic videos that anyone can find on youtube. Genius.</p>
