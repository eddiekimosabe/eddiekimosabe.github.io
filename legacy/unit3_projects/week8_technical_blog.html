		<p>The term memory (computing) refers to data storage devices that are used to store programs or data on temporary/permanent basis for use in a computer. Computers, just like humans, rely on memory. Computers, store data in digital format, which means information can always be called up the way that it was stored. 
<br><br>
            Memory usually refers to RAM (Random Access Memory) which is a primary memory that functions at high speeds. When your computer boots up, it loads the operating system into the RAM which allows your computer to access functions that allow you to do simple tasks such as handling mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. This means that data has been put in the computer's temporary storage area so that the CPU can access that information more easily. The CPU requests the data it needs from RAM, processes it and writes new data back to RAM in a continuous cycle.
<br><br>
        Fast, powerful CPUs need quick access to large amounts of data in order to maximize performance. Modern CPUs can pontentially consume billions of bytes of data per second, but the problem is that memory that can keep up with a such a CPU is extremely expensive. The solution is "tiering" memory which is using expensive memory in small quantities and backing it up with larger quantities of cheaper memory. The hard disk is the cheapest form of memory presently; it provides a vast quantity of inexpensive, permanent storage. The next level is the RAM we were discussing before. After that is the Caches which are small amounts of memory that make the data most used by CPU instantaneously available. The final and fastest form of memory is the register which are memory cells that are built right into the CPU that contain specific data needed by the CPU .
