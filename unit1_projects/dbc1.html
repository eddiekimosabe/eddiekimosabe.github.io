	<h2>Explaining me, myself, and I</h2>
	<p class="firstpar">How do you do? My name is <a href= "mailto:eddiekimosabe@gmail.com">Eddie</a>. I am 23 years old. I am Korean American. I graduated New York University with a bachelors in Economics and a minor in Spanish and Political Science. I have a beagle named <em>Daisy</em> who I love very much. I have a loving family and an awesome girlfriend.</p>
<h2>What I like!</h2>
<p>I have <b>alot</b> of hobbies that I consider myself proficient at. However, I had to compromise on developing some of them in order to pursue mastering the others. It doesn't mean that I have to cut them out of my life cold turkey. But it does mean that I can't go as deep into the craft as I'd prefer to. You win some, you lose some.</p>
<h3>Currently Pursuing</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dance</li>
	<li>Muay Thai</li>
	<li>Powerlifting</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compromised :(</h3>
<ul>
<li>Singing</li>
<li><a href="http://cdn.cutestpaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/l-Im-ready-for-my-guitar-lesson.jpg" target="_top">Guitar</a></li>
<li>Kendo</li>
</ul>

<h2>DAISY!</h2>

<p>Daisy is my 6 year old beagle. She's a girl. And a mix between a bunny and a pig.</p>
<h3>Daisy's Favorite things to do</h3>
<ol>
<li>Eat Eddie's food</li>
<li>Play outside and roll in poop</li>
<li>Smell things for a long time</li>
<li>Chase Squirrels, Cats, and Rabbits</li>
<b><li>Mark everything in the house</li></b>
</ol>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p> One day I'd like to be the WMA 170lb champion.
<br>Have been a backup dancer for a well known hiphop artist</br>
<br>Bench-400+lbs, Deadlift-600+lbs, Squat-500+lbs</br>
<br>Be accomplished musically (whether as a lyricist or performer)</br></p>
