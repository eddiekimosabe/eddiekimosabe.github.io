	<h2>The Mind</h2>
<p>The mind has always been the subject of much speculation/investigation/deliberation/etc… Basically, everyone’s curious about what’s going on in these heads of ours. What I believe, is that the mind makes a good portion of ones’ identity up, if not everything. Humans are very egotistical beings; being such beings we search for answers related to our being- our minds being one big question mark. People have developed numerous methods of recognizing and increasing awareness of said mind.</p>
	<h2>One such person</h2>
<p>Anthony F. Gregoric is a person who has done a lot of research and work on how the mind works. He developed the “Gregoric thinking style” which provides an organized way to consider how the mind works. The Gregoric thinking style separates the mind into two main groups each with its’ own two subgroups, all with their own definitions, which can be found <a href = “http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm”>here</a>. According to this method everyone has some of each groups qualities but generally feel comfortable using one more than the other.</p>
<h2>I AM…</h2>
<p>I am classified, under the Gregoric Thinking Style, as a person with <strong>Concrete Random</strong> and <strong>Abstract Sequential</strong> perceptual qualities and ordering abilities. What does that mean?</p>
