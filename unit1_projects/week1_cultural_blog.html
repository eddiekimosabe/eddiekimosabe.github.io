When I heard about <a href="www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, I thought, “It’s too good to be true”; in my defense I was half right. The traditional mentality that one needs to go through years of education in order to find a job or be considered proficient in a certain skillset still sticks with me. As I’ve ventured out into the world, I have learned that it’s not always true. It’s the quality of the time versus the quantity of time you spend on something that truly develops a person. Sometimes I wonder if my decision to attend Dev Bootcamp was the right decision. Will it aid me in finding a job as a web developer? Did I make an investment that won’t provide me with the intended returns? It’s a risk that scares me yet excites me. I can understand why Dev Bootcamp has produced strong, successful, and curious junior web developers. The workload is heavy but ordered in a way that’ll allow for slow and steady stacking of skills, the environment is full of curious and helpful members, and the staff members are good teachers. I can see the path towards becoming a junior web developer; the goal is visible, but so is all the work that needs to be done.</p> 
<p>After watching Shereef’s fireside chat I felt a little bit better about the behemoth that is Dev Bootcamp. As much as I like to work alone and figure things out by myself, there are times when I will need help and in which another person’s perspective can expand my own. The whole concept that “we’re all in this together” is a refreshing mindset to have. From grade school to college it’s usually about ranking higher than the other and using others for your personal benefit. The using one another is still in Dev Bootcamp but it’s a little nicer and it’s out in the open, so we’re all aware of what we’re getting into. Keeping this concept open and aware fosters a beneficial relationship with one another. Just makes me wanna sing “We’re all in this together” from high school musical with my cohort. (You now have the song stuck in your head. You’re welcome :] ) Like Shereef had mentioned in his fireside chat the hardest thing to deal with will be the person next to you. But if we all go in with the mentality to help one another as much as we want to help ourselves, I think some awesome lessons can come out of it.</p>
<p>I’m just looking forward to growing as a person and as a developer and the best way to do that is to meet many different kinds of people, butt heads with them, and code. I want to become better than what I was yesterday. Dev Bootcamp is definitely a way to test myself and grow. I’m nervous. I’m excited. I’m ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s do this.
