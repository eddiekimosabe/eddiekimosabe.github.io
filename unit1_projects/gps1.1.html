        <h2>Introduction to Pair Programming</h2>
        <p>
         <img src="http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/43/75/2506562/5/628x471.jpg" alt=""> Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one station, whether it be in person or remotely. One person, the driver, writes the code, while the other person, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed. These two roles are switched between people depending on how they feel, what they planned, and a multitude of reasons. As the navigator reviews the code, he also considers the strategy and direction of the work. The navigator creates solutions and improvements for potential problems while the driver is free to code without having to worry about problems outside his assigned task. However, both programmers can dabble in one another’s territory depending on the workers’ chemistry and an understanding of one another’s work methods. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Importance of Pair Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Pair programming can help assist programmers become more productive and
          more knowledgeable at their jobs. By using the driver and navigator concept
          you are allowing two people to take up individual tasks, rather than having
          to multi-task. Additionally when you have someone working at the same 
          workstation with you it will help you maintain focus in this 
          concentration challenged age. Another wonderful thing about pair 
          programming is that you will learn faster; this happens when you're 
          either explaining why you're doing something the way you're doing it 
          or by asking questions about why someone is solving the problem with a 
          certain method. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>After Gunnari and I have had our guided pairing session we have both agreed 
        to reflect and discuss on how we felt about pairing sessions. We’ve realized that 
        we respect each other’s time so we end up focusing more and finishing the work faster than one 
        would individually. We learned different programming techniques/styles from one another as there 
        are numerous ways of saying the same thing. We both got along well and we met a new coding buddy. 
        Overall, the pairing session was a positive learning experience.
