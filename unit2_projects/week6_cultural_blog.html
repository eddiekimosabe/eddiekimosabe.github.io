	<h2>Living on the edge</h2>

		<p>I’m over Stereotype threats. I’m not denying its’ existence because it’ll be with humanity for as long as there is variety in the human genome, which is forever. However, I am personally done with letting it shape my identity. I will always be aware of what I am, because part of what I am is reflected off what people perceive me to be. But perception is less than skin deep. If anything it’s above the skin. It’s mirage that we surround ourselves with. 
			<br>
			<br>
			For years I’ve tried to adjust the way I spoke, dressed, looked, and acted so that I could appear less than what society though me to be. But why did I do that? Why wasn’t I proud of the other identities that made me up? Well, I am an Asian adult male in his early 20s. According to stereotypes, I’m good at math, I’m not particularly athletic/creative/socially adept, I do some form of martial arts, I eat cats/dogs/scorpions/babies, and I’m not masculine. Since I’m the 2nd generation Asian American, I should probably be a doctor, finance analyst, dentist, lawyer, or accountant. Since I’m Korean I should be stubborn, a bad boyfriend/husband, angry, and ignorant. The list can go on and on. These are all things that have been constantly said to me, I’ve overheard, or that have been portrayed in society. I literally wrote this off the top of my head. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Now some may be good and most may be bad, but altogether it’s unacceptable. As humans grow up they try to figure out who they are. The options are few when a person tries to learn his/her identity; it’s usually from within themselves and mostly from other peoples’ viewpoints. Now that’s the biggest problem. Humanity has developed this mindset that chains peoples’ potentials to their race/nation. A handful of reasons out of a million others is the sole cause for why a person is the way they are. I find that reasoning flawed.     
			<br>
			<br>
			To me, I am Eddie. I am a person. I like to dance, sing, play the guitar, experience new things, etc… The list can go on and on. There are a lot of layers to me. I’m like an onion. I don’t have one type of emotion. I don’t have one hobby. I don’t enjoy just one type of thing. I’m very complex yet at the same time very simple. Yes, I know, we’re getting very meta here, but that’s just what any organism in the world is like. I am what I am, whether someone else likes it or not.
			<br>
			<br>
			To be honest, I’d like to stop talking about this matter. I get very tired thinking about it. It’s like beating a dead horse with a stick. All I know is that I treat everyone the way they want to be treated and I identify them the way that they would like for me to identify them, I just hope that they do the same for me. I don’t try to eliminate the whole race aspect because that is part of their identity and how they interact with other people. I just try to be aware, compassionate, loving, happy, and fun and I try to enjoy the company of someone so different yet so similar to me.
