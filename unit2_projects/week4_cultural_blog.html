	<h2>Hacked</h2>
		<p>
			With the increase of technological assimilation, cyber-security has been an ever-growing issue for us humans.
			We've found intelligent ways to put computers into every nook and cranny of our everyday lives and to make it even better we've found ways to connect it all to the internet. Who is to say that there aren't a handful of individuals capable of manipulating any form of computer to do whatever they wanted. All they would need is the right code to talk to the machine. I believe that the rate at which we are creating new computers and programs far exceeds the rate at which security programs are being created. 
			<br>
			<br>
			To be honest, I don't think anyone who uses an electronic device is safe, whether it be an air conditioner or a car. Any device with some sort of computer can be manipulated. When I talk about computers I don't mean the laptops or the desktop computers that we are currently using, but anything with a central processing unit and some memory, which means basically everything with some electrical charge nowadays. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Every other week we hear about large companies, with stores of information on their customers, having their systems hacked and their data stolen. From bank account numbers to social security numbers to basic information on a person, any form of information can be potentially stolen. Yet, modern societies still use these technologies without too much care for security and without much knowledge on just what is going on within the cyber realm.
			<br>
			<br>
			People don't realize the variety of ways computers can be hacked. Just because there's one firewall up, or an adblocker, or Mcafee (so help me God) doesn't mean that you're automatically safe. Hackers evolve and so do their hacking techniques, also the universe of the internet is expanding. Everyday a new technology with new programs is created and everyday hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, jump on the technological bandwagon and put themselves under the mercy of a hacker. Heck maybe a hacker can create an awesome program that everyone wants to use and inserts some viral code that he might want to use when he just wants to see the world burn. 
			<br>
			<br>
			All I'm saying is that we as a society should be more aware of the dangers of the internet and take aims to educate and protect ourselves before we download a program, go to an unknown website, or buy some new technology. It's the wild wild west out here except it's the nerds who are the bandits and the sheriffs around these parts. So nerd up and arm yourself with some knowledge.
